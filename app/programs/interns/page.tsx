        "Being a tasa intern was one of the coolest experiences I've ever been a part of at UCSB. Not only was I able to meet some of my closest friends, but I was also able to learn how TASA runs their events behind the scenes. My favorite part of it all was the ability to express my creativity in a productive and fun environment towards exciting events such as night market and the intern event (Nin-TASA Olympics). Being an intern has inspired me to continue to work on cool projects for the community as a tasa staff member!",

        "At first I was a little hesitant to apply, since I was unsure if I would be accepted as part of the intern team. However, in the end I decided to give it a shot and Iâ€™m so thankful that I did. The intern program gave me a deep insight into how TASA staff works in the background and also gave me the opportunity to create my closest friends I have in UCSB! Even during the busiest moments during the intern program, I still had so much fun because we weren't just working as a team, but as friends.",

I was able to learn a lot about the inner workings of TASA and the amount of effort that goes into planning events. I also got to meet a lot of new people and make new friends. My favorite projects were working on the 2022 TASA Merch and helping plan the Night Market! Overall, I had a great time and would definitely recommend applying to be an intern!",
